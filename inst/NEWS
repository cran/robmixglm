Changes in robmixglm version 1.2-4

  o fix bug which cause fail when model only contained an intercept

  o change of e-mail address

Changes in robmixglm version 1.2-3

  o fail gracefully if no starting values found.

  o fix e-mail address.

Changes in robmixglm version 1.2-2

  o changed starting values for fitting in bootstrap outlier test. This causes a slight change in results.

Changes in robmixglm version 1.2-1

  o changed gaussian so that outliers have variance sigma^2 outliers rather than sigma^2+tau^2.
  
  o improved speed of multiple cores

  o changed default number of multiple cores to number of cores divided by 2 (this has only slightly less speed)

  o tidied up vignette

Changes in robmixglm version 1.2-0

  o added negative binomial distribution

  o fixed bug causing too many displays of failure to find starting values message

  o increased number of random starting values to 50 to make finding the global maximum more likely

  o improved calculation of standard errors

Changes in robmixglm version 1.1-1
  
  o use multiple cores for determining starting values (if this causes problems then set cores=1)

  o tidied up code for testing outliers

  o improved error handling in outlier test

  o fixed bug in starting values for gaussian models

Changes in robmixglm version 1.1-0

  o added predict method

  o implemented bootstrap for testing for outliers using multiple cores (if this causes problems then set cores=1)

  o removed progress show from outlier test (this won't work properly with multiple cores)
  
  o set examples to donttest to satisfy CRAN checks
 
Changes in robmixglm version 1.0-4

  o fixed numerical problems

  o improved selection of starting values, especially with small number of observations

Changes in robmixglm version 1.0-3

  o fixed error due to changes in class() behaviour by replacing with inherits when appropriate

Changes in robmixglm version 1.0-2

  o added extra sentences in description

  o changed dontrun to donttest

  o changed several examples to allow running as part of check

Changes in robmixglm version 1.0-1

  o first release
